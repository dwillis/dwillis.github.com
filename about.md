## About The Scoop

This site is owned and operated by me, Derek Willis, and is not affiliated with nor a representation of [my current employer](https://www.propublica.org/) or any past (or future) employers. Since being launched in 1998, The Scoop has largely focused on journalism, computer-assisted reporting and web development and in 2003 I decided to make those the exclusive topics of this site. My personal site is [dwillis.net](http://dwillis.net). None of my sites speak for my employer; they contain my views only.

### What I Work On

I teach data and computational journalism at the [Philip Merrill College of Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, where I try to get students excited about interviewing data and using it to make for better and different stories.

In my spare time, I write a weekly newsletter for [Decision Desk HQ](https://decisiondeskhq.com/), a leading provider of live election results and related data, and I analyze women's college basketball at Her Hoop Stats.

Most of my previous work revolved around finding, acquiring and using political and legislative data for journalism. That meant [scraping web sites for congressional data](https://github.com/dwillis/statement), building [APIs](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/) and helping my colleagues build [interactives that explore important issues](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/). Every now and then I got some [writing published](https://www.propublica.org/article/will-nancy-pelosi-open-the-floor-to-bipartisan-ideas), too.

I also help run a volunteer project on election results called [OpenElections](http://blog.openelections.net/). I'm lucky enough to be able to speak at conferences and other venues about journalism, data and elections, or some combination of the three. And I helped build a college football data site and [co-wrote a paper on cricket](https://github.com/dwillis/toss-up/blob/master/write_up/cricket.pdf).

### About Me

I was born in Pennsylvania, graduated from the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu/) with a degree in rhetoric and communications and attended graduate school at the University of Florida. I began my journalism career at [The Palm Beach Post](http://www.pbpost.com/), working in the news library and then as a reporter and technology coordinator. From 1998-2003 I covered Congress and elections for [Congressional Quarterly](http://www.cq.com/). In February 2003 I joined [The Center for Public Integrity](http://www.publicintegrity.org/) as a writer/data specialist working on state and federal projects, where [a report I co-authored](http://www.publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/silent-partners) was honored with a [Sigma Delta Chi award](http://www.spj.org/news.asp?ref=364) by the Society of Professional Journalists. In November 2004 I became the Research Database Editor at the Washington Post; in February 2007 I became Database Editor at washingtonpost.com, and in November 2007 I became an Interactive Developer with The New York Times, working mostly on political and election-related applications and APIs. I joined [The Upshot](https://www.nytimes.com/by/derek-willis) in 2014. From 2015-2021, I worked as a [News Applications Developer at ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/people/derek-willis).

I was co-editor of CQ’s Federal PACs Directory, published in 1998, and of Unstacking the Deck, a guide to covering campaign finance [published by Investigative Reporters and Editors](http://www.ire.org/resource-center/books/). I’ve been a member of IRE since 1995 and have spoken at numerous conferences and training events around the nation on using the Internet and campaign finance data. I have served as an adjunct faculty member at The George Washington University, Northwestern University and Georgetown University, teaching data reporting classes. I live outside Washington, D.C., with my wife, daughter and two cats. Email me at dwillis AT gmail DOT com.
