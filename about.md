## About The Scoop

This site is owned and operated by me, Derek Willis, and is not affiliated with nor a representation of [my current employer](http://www.nytimes.com/) or any past (or future) employers. Since being launched in 1998, The Scoop has largely focused on journalism, computer-assisted reporting and web development and in 2003 I decided to make those the exclusive topics of this site. My personal site is [dwillis.net](http://dwillis.net). None of my sites speak for my employer; they contain my views only.

### What I Work On

Most of my work revolves around finding, acquiring and using political and legislative data for journalism. That means [scraping web sites for congressional data](https://github.com/newsdev/statement), building [APIs](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/campaign_finance_api/) and helping my colleagues build [interactives that explore important issues](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/03/us/politics/women-on-senate-committees.html). Every now and then I get some [writing published](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/tracking-hastert-rule-violations-in-the-hous/), too.

I'm also part of a Knight Foundation-funded project on election results called [OpenElections](http://blog.openelections.net/) and I teach [reporting with data](http://dwillis.github.io/data-reporting/index.html) to college students. I'm lucky enough to be able to speak at conferences and other venues about journalism, data and elections, or some combination of the three. And I helped build a [college football data site](http://cfbreference.com/).

### About Me

I was born in Pennsylvania, graduated from the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu/) with a degree in rhetoric and communications and attended graduate school at the University of Florida. I began my journalism career at [The Palm Beach Post](http://www.pbpost.com/), working in the news library and then as a reporter and technology coordinator. From 1998-2003 I covered Congress and elections for [Congressional Quarterly](http://www.cq.com/). In February 2003 I joined [The Center for Public Integrity](http://www.publicintegrity.org/) as a writer/data specialist working on state and federal projects, where [a report I co-authored](http://www.publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/silent-partners) was honored with a [Sigma Delta Chi award](http://www.spj.org/news.asp?ref=364) by the Society of Professional Journalists. In November 2004 I became the Research Database Editor at the Washington Post; in February 2007 I became Database Editor at washingtonpost.com, and in November 2007 I became an Interactive Developer with The New York Times, working mostly on political and election-related applications and APIs.

I was co-editor of CQ’s Federal PACs Directory, published in 1998, and of Unstacking the Deck, a guide to covering campaign finance [published by Investigative Reporters and Editors](http://www.ire.org/resource-center/books/). I’ve been a member of IRE since 1995 and have spoken at numerous conferences and training events around the nation on using the Internet and campaign finance data. I have served as an adjunct faculty member at The George Washington University, Northwestern University and Georgetown University, teaching data reporting classes. I live outside Washington, D.C., with my wife, daughter and a cat named Tuna. Email me at dwillis AT gmail DOT com.
