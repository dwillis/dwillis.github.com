#
# Description: Very simple script to make you
# select a region of your screen, which will be captured, and
# then uploaded. The URL will then be injected into your clipboard.
#
# Dependencies:
#
# Imgur Bash Upload Script (http://imgur.com/tools/imgurbash.sh)
# Comment: Must be in path (see below) with the name "imgur" (not imgur.sh)
#
# Scrot
# Comment: Scrot is what takes the actual screenshot.
#
# Xclip
# Comment: Xclip is what makes the script able to inject the direct url
# into your clipboard.
#
# libnotify*
# Comment: Will notify you whenever the direct URL is in the clipboard
#
# Installation:
#
# Move the file to a local bin. And put the path of this bin, into
# your path. (See: www.troubleshooters.com/linux/prepostpath.htm)
#
# From then on, you can either activate it via your terminal, or via
# your window manager or similar, so you can bind it to a keycombination.
