title: Teaching Hospitals, Journalism Education and a Hatchet Job
---

[Donica Mensing](https://twitter.com/donica) and [David Ryfe](https://twitter.com/dryfe) from the Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno, have published [a paper](http://www.academia.edu/3412374/Blueprint_for_Change_From_the_Teaching_Hospital_to_the_Entrepreneurial_Model_of_Journalism_Education) that attempts to argue that recent attempts by foundations and others advocating for a "[teaching hospital](http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/other/open-letter-americas-university-presidents/)" approach to journalism education, while well-intentioned, is actually some sort of "back to the future" plan that would enshrine the journalistic norms of the 1960s and (I am not making this up, I swear) "could actually slow the response to change" by journalism schools.

Three questions come to mind: First, could anything _really_ slow the response we've seen so far from academia? Second, is that what the teaching hospital model is really about? And third, this is scholarship?

The paper is not purely a critique of the teaching hospital method, although it surely attacks that task with fervor. It also advocates for an "entrepreneurial model" of journalism education, saying that "The groundswell of grassroots activity in civic entrepreneurship, social innovation, user centered design and related practices represent a reservoir of potential energy that could invigorate journalism education."

Sounds like some buzzword bingo, that hallmark of well-grounded research. "Social innovation!"

The easiest way to win an argument, of course, is to make the other side so unappealing that no rational person would choose it. This is done through a variety of methods: the use of straw men, unsupported claims and other tactics common to, say, Lee Atwater. An important part is to attribute things to your opponent that sound awful but possible. That's what Mensing and Ryfe do in this paper.

In describing the teaching hospital model of journalism education, they write that it:

*	"implies that journalism is a settled profession with clear boundaries that needs only to be practiced more rigorously, instead of a field with its most fundamental premises unraveling"
*	"makes it hard for students to think differently"
*	argues that "the core of journalism is sound and the problems faced by the news industry are primarily technological and economic"
*	"forecasts a future for journalism that is infused with the practices of the past"
*	assumes that the answers to the question of how to add value to democratic community are "fixed and eternal"
*	calls for "saving the journalism industry by turning journalism schools into production facilities staffed by industry professionals who have left an industry in deep distress"

Just two of those claims has a cited reference (one is a paper, shockingly enough, by one of the authors!). In other words, the reader is led to believe that, having surveyed the teaching hospital model, the authors have found that it is regressive, inflexible and hopelessly tied to the past.

That sounds pretty bad, right? Is there some evidence for those descriptions? A statement by the "teaching hospital advocates" that plants a flag in the soil of regressive education practices?

Here's what Eric Newton, an author of the teaching hospital open letter linked above, [had to say about the teaching hospital model](http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/08/do-journalism-schools-really-need-to-be-teaching-hospitals/#comment-1010807645): 

> "Teaching Hospital" Model: A model of learning-by-doing that includes college students, professors and professionals working together under one 'digital roof' for the benefit of a community. Student journalists provide news and engage the community in innovative ways. Top professionals support and guide them. Good researchers help design and study their experiments.

> If it's old school, it's not a teaching hospital. If it doesn't include research, it's not a teaching hospital. If it doesn't engage the community, it's not a teaching hospital. If professors and professionals don't set aside their long-standing arguments and work together, it's not a teaching hospital.

> Teaching hospitals help invent and test new things. That's why a group of funders said at this year's journalism education convention that we are working on a micro-granting competition. The grant program, to be announced later this year, will support "live news experiments." We hope that good examples will clarify what good journalistic teaching hospitals should do.

At this point, I should say that [a project that I co-founded](http://blog.openelections.net) is a recipient of money from the Knight Foundation, where Eric works. I've never met Eric, nor have we communicated on the subject of journalism education.

If you read that definition (and the [open letter](http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/other/open-letter-americas-university-presidents/)) it might strike you as not at all what Mensing and Ryfe describe. Yet somehow they've cast it in this rather negative light. As [Carrie Brown-Smith](https://twitter.com/Brizzyc), a professor at the University of Memphis, put it: "[I'm just unclear who or what is actually being rebutted here](http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/08/do-journalism-schools-really-need-to-be-teaching-hospitals/#comment-1011505711)." You and me both, Doctor.

There is no reason - none at all - why teaching hospital models cannot be "entrepreneurial" as described by the authors. Indeed, there are [examples](http://www.ist.rit.edu/~jxs/classes/proposed/JournPubIn21stCent.html) of this that combine the best ideas of both models. I am not aware of anyone advocating for a regressive teaching hospital model the authors describe. If they are, they do not cite any in the paper (and if they know of some, why wouldn't they cite it?).

To the extent that journalism schools are failing to keep pace with the very real changes in the practice of journalism (professional or not), it's very hard to see how the involving more professionals in the process is a harmful thing. But that's not what the authors argue against - they write that teaching hospital advocates are seeking to _replace_ existing faculty members with professionals "who have left an industry in deep distress". If this weren't silly on its face, you could almost hear the hiss of "traitors!" being hurled at those professionals who came slouching over to industry to poison the minds of idealistic students. Makes for a great story, except for the not being true part.

This paper sets up the teaching hospital model as a straw man standing in the way of a more flexible, creative and successful model of journalism education, and then proceeds to cut that straw man down in order to make the other model look better. The authors write that they wish to "build on this conversation" surrounding the future of journalism education, but instead the reader is treated to a lesson in how to win an argument by stacking the deck.

That isn't scholarship; it's a hatchet job.
