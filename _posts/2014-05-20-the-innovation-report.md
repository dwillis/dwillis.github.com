## The Innovation Report

Twitter followers may have noticed that over the weekend [I posted some opinions about the leaked Innovation Report](https://storify.com/mfriesen/derek-willis-on-the-nyt-innovation-report) produced by a committee of my colleagues at The New York Times. The report itself was never intended for a wide audience, which explains some of its wording and structure, but it is public now. There should be a wider debate about it.

One option is to send an email to all of my colleagues, but that would be not only presumptuous but also a pretty inefficient way to do it. Given that newsroom inefficiency is something I care about, the other option is to pass it around to a selection of my colleagues. But most of them probably a) know how I feel and, worse, probably agree with me in large part. That's not exactly a conversation.

So, there's the public option. To the extent that we can have a public conversation about how we go forward, here's my view, expanded from the original tweets:

I believe that this report is a brave and necessary attempt to address an issue of enormous consequence for The Times: how we can best address both the opportunities and challenges presented by a transition from a mostly print-focused product and readership to a digital report and audience. On the bulk of the goals and ideas advanced by the committee I am in  agreement.

But as someone who has worked at the intersection of the newsroom and technology for a decade (nearly seven years at The Times), I would like to make two points: First, inaccuracies in the report could lead an inexperienced reader to make assumptions (and, more important, decisions) that could be detrimental to the future of the company or could actually slow down, rather than accelerate, the movement that we need.

Second, that the report doesn't go far enough in addressing even more fundamental challenges. The newsroom's incentives are even more poorly aligned with a digital future than the report makes clear. I believe that we have some structural problems with our workflow, but these are low-hanging fruit compared to the structural problems we have with the approach that too many Times journalists take to how we do what we do. While the report recommends "sending clear signals about goals, changing reward structures and basing promotions on behavior that moves us toward our digital future," it could go much further in making explicit recommendations or suggestions for what the newsroom can and should do.

I realize that the intended audience for this report originally consisted of two people, although I think that imagining it would remain unavailable to Times journalists was naive. The full report should have been available to all of us, since the questions it addresses are central to our collective future.

### A Misleading Picture

The report rightly identifies the tricky balance between building one-offs and replicability in digital projects. In particular, it says that newsroom teams are spending too much time on these labor intensive projects, at the expense of making "necessary improvements to allow our graphics to appear on mobile." This is misleading in several respects to an inexperienced reader, who may logically conclude that the two choices are solely within the purview of those newsroom teams (how many people know which groups are responsible for making graphics appear on mobiled devices?).

It goes on to say that our competitors are focused not on building Snow Fall but on "a Snow Fall builder", leaving the impression that we do not have such a thing. We do, and Graphics would have been able to tell you so. In fact, it was the _result_ of Snow Fall. This misrepresents what we are doing, and why, and could reasonably lead to the impression that the priorities of Graphics and INT are out of balance. As a member of INT for more than six years, I can tell you that we have placed a priority on re-using our work. If we didn't, we could not have been able to meet the goals set by our leadership.

Every live dashboard - desired by desks around the newsroom in the past few years - was built atop a common code base and enhanced for case-specific needs. In election results, we switched four years ago to generating InDesign code programatically so that Graphics editors could put result maps into the paper nearly as fast as they appeared online. The same application used to help reporters navigate campaign finance data also provides an API to make it easier to build interactives. Even with the size of the Graphics and INT, replication is critical. This is not an either/or situation: we have to do both, and we do. A reader of this report would not get that impression.

The report then quickly shifts to platform innovation, which I agree is critical. But it does not explicitly define what it means by that, and without that context, the inexperienced reader could get the impression that these are among the responsibilities of newsroom teams and that instead they are choosing to spend time on intensive one-offs (that aren't, in many cases, one-offs). Scoop is a very good production system; it needs to become an excellent authoring and editing system, too.

On page 42, the report discusses an important topic: metadata and tagging efforts. I completely agree that these are extremely important to our digital efforts, but the discussion omits any responsibility on the people who are supposed to be doing the initial tagging: reporters and editors. In my time working on The Caucus blog, I rarely came across a post that even had auto-suggested tags with it. The report mainly dwells on the work of the Archive, Metadata and Search team (with a brief mention of copy editors, web producers and librarians), making it seem as if this is solely the problem of that group. It is not, and such impressions only reinforce the divide between newsroom staffers and business-side employees. Reporters and editors have as much at stake in the proper archiving and tagging of their work as anyone else in the company. The report needed to make it clear that they share responsibility.

The section on promotion and the social team neglects to place any responsibility on reporters and editors. It is as if social media is something that happens to them rather than them being involved or taking personal initiative. When the report highlights the examples of Times reporters who learned valuable social media techniques as part of book projects and then compares it to the overall condition of social, why would it not also examime whether and why editors and desks would not play a role in adopting best practices instead of laying it at the feet of the social team? 

From my vantage point in D.C., I know that the Social team has made regular efforts at training our journalists here, and does so in New York. These trainings are, as-ever, optional and not given the priority that they should be. There are ways that Social, INT and other groups at The Times can be better about spreading what they know to our colleagues, but such efforts will not succeed as a one-way pipeline. (Incidentally, the only reason that the institutional Twitter account is in the newsroom - where it should be - is because a developer fought to keep it there when no reporter or editor cared.)

On page 78, the report blames the existence and structure of INT, Graphics, Social and Design for web producers lacking opportunities to experiment. This is both deeply misleading and overlooks how desks have defined the role of web producers. Web producers should be hired on the basis of their ability to create and experiment online, not because they want to be Times reporters or copy editors. Desks pretend that they hire producers and then assign them reporting duties; job applicants pretend they are interested in copying and pasting stories into Scoop and then launch themselves into reporting projects. The outcome is predictable and detrimental to the company. To blame the more technical groups in the newsroom without addressing this fundamental issue is a disservice. We owe the masthead (and the entire staff) the truth so that we can make the necessary changes.

### An Overlooked Lack of Newsroom Responsibilty

A repeated theme in the report is that reporters and  editors need to be urged, taught, led to learn more about social media and digital tools. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of who we are and what we should be doing. We are journalists; when we don't know something, we try to find out. But the attitude represented time and again in the report is one of passivity on the part of our employees:

* "Our journalists want maximum readership and impact but many don’t know how to use social media effectively."
* "Reporters and editors are eager to do what is asked of them, as long as they have clarity on both how and why — as well as some assurance that the extra effort will be rewarded."
* "Part of the problem is that editors often don’t understand what colleagues who work in these Reader Experience roles can do to help improve our report."
* “I had no idea who to reach out to and it never would have occurred to me to do it."

It is painful to me that these are attitudes expressed by my colleagues, the best journalists in the world. It should be alarming to all of us.

We would not accept such an approach in reporting. My biggest concern in the entire report: that innovation is mainly described as something that happens _to_ the newsroom, not something that is created with the newsroom's participation. This disconnect, which has gone unaddressed, is what can cause the other, worthy recommendations in this report to founder. To use an example in the report that caused me to simultaneously laugh and cry, KJ Dell'Antonia "paid an assistant out of her own pocket to go through her old emails to pull reader addresses." There are multiple software libraries that could have done this in little time and for no money. I and dozens of my colleagues could have done it. But there is no incentive for newsroom staffers to think about the possibilities, or worse, to even ask. We need to educate our newsroom on how technology can reduce the amount of repetitive work they have to do and help them to find and tell stories that otherwise would remain hidden.

That one example is a small problem in the scheme of things, but the newsroom needs to take responsibility on problems large and small that have digital solutions. Platform innovation needs to involve not only the newsroom's ideas; reporters should be working directly in Scoop as much as possible as soon as possible to make its improvement possible. Scoop developers have little idea how people actually use it, because so few people do.

This avoidance of the responsibility of learning by the newsroom will be a drag on any movement toward a digital-first future. The problem is all of us, and the newsroom needs to hear that loudly and clearly and repeatedly from the highest levels and from editors and their colleagues. Sadly, the report does little to highlight this gap.

### Digital Talent

There are many good recommendations about attracting and retaining "digital talent," but this language and emphasis needlessly permits existing reporters and editors to say, "They are not talking about me." As you know, attracting top talent is difficult, so why would we not also emphasize growing our own from the supremely smart and able people we have here at The Times? Every time we say "digital talent" instead of "talent", we're effectively endorsing a partition of responsibilities.

I disagree that digital staffers need to be singled out for praise and prizes as a method of retaining and encouraging them. Recognition is nice and appreciated, but I think recognizing "digital" skills and accomplishments is yet another sign to the newsroom that these are not skills that they are responsible for learning.

It's time that we emphasize that talent is talent, and we will both hire people with it and develop it, but there will be no meaningful distinction between "digital" and "non-digital" talent. I don't tell people that I am a digital journalist. Our leadership should emphasize that the distinction is meaningless to them as well, and that we all share the responsibilities, even though we don't all do exactly the same things.

If we don't reinforce, repeatedly, the notion that we have a collective responsibility for improving our digital skills and product, then we risk that a strategy group, however well-organized and staffed, will be little more an occupying force to be endured but not respected by a newsroom without incentive to adapt. What we need is a clear statement that there is no going back.
