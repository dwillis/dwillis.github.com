title: White House Beat Feature Request

Ok, I love the fact that CBS Radio's [Mark Knoller](http://www.cbsnews.com/team/mark-knoller/) keeps such [good tabs on presidential travel](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/counting-the-days-bush-stays-at-camp-david/), but can somebody please come up with a backup plan in case, heaven forbid, Knoller gets hit by a bus or something? Is this too much to ask of WH reporters? This is the kind of thing where somebody out there is going to do a better job of gathering and displaying this data on the Web. And it should be us, cause it's our job.
