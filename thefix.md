This is a series of essays on the future of journalism and some of my ideas on how advances in technology have changed the way that we report and write the news. Your comments are welcome at dwillis AT gmail DOT com.

[The Collaboration Issue](http://thescoop.org/thefix/the-collaboration-issue/), 4/29/2005

Journalism suffers from an inability to recognize the shifts in ownership of information and from an astonishingly weak response to the changes that have taken place in the way that information is gathered and disseminated.

[The Information Gap](http://thescoop.org/thefix/the-information-gap/), 5/09/2005

With increased access to information comes a greater need for better management of it.

[The Annotated Archive](http://thescoop.org/thefix/the-annotated-archive/), 5/20/2005

The archive that newspapers provide to their employees should be more valuable than the one they sell to vendors.

[The Engagement Process](http://thescoop.org/thefix/the-engagement-process/), 6/8/2005

Now plenty of media outlets have blogs, chats and other platforms that allow readers and viewers to get a little closer to their news outlets. But we should be doing more.

[Rivers of Data](http://thescoop.org/thefix/rivers-of-data/), 8/9/2005

It’s time we grappled with the permanent river of data. Because like news, data never stops.

[Innovate or Die](http://thescoop.org/thefix/innovate-or-die/), 11/14/2005

If [news libraries] drive innovation in the newsroom, we become invaluable to the growth and success of the paper.

[Putting It Out There](http://thescoop.org/thefix/putting-it-out-there/), 4/15/2006

Among the changes that technology has given us, few may be as influential in the long-term as the irresistable movement forcing news organizations to open up.

[Journalism Lost – and Found](http://thescoop.org/thefix/journalism-lost-and-found/), 6/5/2006

What newspapers need, not just at buyout time but all the time, is a plan to capture as much information and expertise as they can during the tenure of their employees.

[The Canvas for CAR](http://thescoop.org/thefix/the-canvas-for-car/), 1/13/2007

The Web is the canvas for CAR, better than any other platform we’ve come up with as an industry.

[Better Tools](http://thescoop.org/thefix/better-tools/), 5/19/2007

The tools for reporting and analysis have improved so much and become so accessible that we are falling behind in the race for more insightful and original stories.
