title: "What I'm Doing Now"
---

I teach data and computational journalism at the [Philip Merrill College of Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, where I try to get students excited about interviewing data and using it to make for better and different stories.

In my spare time, I write a weekly newsletter for [Decision Desk HQ](https://decisiondeskhq.com/), a leading provider of live election results and related data, and analyze women's college basketball data for [Her Hoop Stats](https://substack.com/profile/2904097-derek-willis).

I also run a volunteer project on election results called [OpenElections](https://github.com/openelections). You can help us collect and convert official precinct-level election results!
